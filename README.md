# Work Updates for branch (post-details-page) Carlos
`--------------------------------------------------`

1. Create the Dynamic Route File
Created a new file called `app/post/[id].tsx`. This creates a dynamic route where `[id]` will be replaced with the actual post ID in the URL, allowing for individual post viewing.

2. Modify Post Card Navigation
Updated the `handlePostPress` function in `PublicPostsList.tsx` to navigate to the detail view when a post is tapped, using Expo Router's navigation with the post ID as a parameter.
