because this is a group project i will be focusing on particular part of the project based on the features
we are working on and i will luckily be working on number 2 down to 4 but it's good to have everything done
so that i can implement what i need to so for every feature it cannot be thighly coupled because there has to be 
seperation of concern.
I can think of two screens now, very much like what we have done in class and homework: 
1.home screen, e.g. the navigation, display the posts
2.user screen, showing some user info, and posts, 
3. map view, just to use an exteranl API to show a map, for now
4. detail screen
adding to 1, an external API for weather
