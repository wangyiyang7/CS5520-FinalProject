After reviewing the project documents and task requirements, I can see that the "Local Buzz" app is coming along well with some foundational components already built. Let's analyze what's been done and what needs to be implemented next, focusing on your assignment to handle posts and map features.

## Current State of the Project

The project already has:
- Basic app structure with navigation (tabs and stack)
- Authentication system setup
- Profile management
- Firebase integration (Auth & Firestore)
- Weather API integration
- Post service with model definitions
- Post detail screen ([id].tsx)
- Basic UI components

## What Needs to Be Done Next

Based on your assigned tasks, here's what we need to focus on:

1. **Posts Creation Interface**:
   - Create a form for users to submit new posts
   - Integrate camera functionality (using the ImageManager.tsx as reference)
   - Add location selection/capture

2. **Map View Implementation**:
   - Set up the map screen with markers for posts
   - Link posts to their locations on the map
   - Add interaction between map markers and post details

3. **Posts CRUD Operations**:
   - Implement create, read, update, delete functionality for posts
   - Ensure proper security rules

4. **Enhance Post Detail View**:
   - Add verification/like functionality
   - Connect post detail to map view

## How to Proceed

Let's tackle this step by step:

### Step 1: Complete the Post Creation Form

We should start by implementing the post creation interface since this is foundational. The current `post.tsx` file in the `/(tabs)` directory is just a placeholder. We need to:

1. Create a proper form for post creation
2. Integrate the camera functionality (similar to the provided ImageManager.tsx)
3. Add location capture
4. Submit the post to Firestore

### Step 2: Implement the Map View

The map.tsx file is also a placeholder. We need to:

1. Implement a proper map view using a mapping library
2. Fetch posts with location data
3. Display markers on the map
4. Make markers interactive to view post details

### Step 3: Enhance Post Detail View

The post detail view ([id].tsx) already exists but needs enhancement:

1. Add like and verify functionality
2. Show location on a mini-map
3. Link to the full map view

## Implementation Plan for Post Creation Form

Let's start with implementing the post creation form:

1. We'll modify the existing `post.tsx` file to include:
   - Form fields for title, content, and category
   - Camera integration using principles from ImageManager.tsx
   - Location capture
   - Submit functionality

2. Ensure the form validates input and gives proper feedback
3. Connect the form to the PostService to create new posts

We'll need to use components like TextInput, Pickers for categories, the camera component, and a map component for location selection.

Would you like me to start by outlining the code for the post creation form first? Or would you prefer I start with another component?
