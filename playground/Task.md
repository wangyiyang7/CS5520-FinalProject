Based on the requirements for Iteration 1 and your specific role, here's my recommendation for how to approach this:
Task Division for Your Team
For Your Colleague:

Authentication System:

Complete the login and signup functionality
Ensure Firebase Auth is properly connected
Implement password reset functionality
Create proper error handling and validation


Navigation Setup:

Ensure the tab navigation is working correctly
Implement proper stack navigation for auth flows
Fix any navigation styling issues


User Profile:

Basic user profile data storage and retrieval
Profile settings screen



For You (Post and Map Features):

Posts Collection and CRUD:

Implement the Posts collection in Firestore
Create the post creation interface with camera integration
Implement post listing on the main feed
Set up post detail view


Map Integration:

Implement the map view with location markers
Connect posts to locations on the map
Add interaction capabilities for map markers


Enhance Post Detail:

Create detailed post view with all metadata
Add verification/like functionality
Connect post detail to map view



Where You Should Start
I recommend you start with:

Posts Collection Implementation:

Define the data structure for posts
Set up Firestore security rules
Create the service layer for post CRUD operations


Post Creation UI:

Create the post creation form
Implement camera integration
Add location picking


Post Feed Display:

Implement the main feed to show posts
Add filtering and sorting capabilities


Map View:

After basic posts are working, implement the map view
Connect posts to map markers



Data Model for Your README
Here's a clear description of the data model you can use for your README:
1. Users Collection
Copyusers/{userId}
  - username: string
  - email: string
  - photoURL: string (optional)
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - lastLogin: timestamp
  - notificationPreferences: object
2. Posts Collection
Copyposts/{postId}
  - title: string
  - content: string
  - photoURL: string (optional)
  - location: geopoint
  - category: string (Traffic, Safety, Event, Infrastructure, Other)
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - authorId: string (reference to users collection)
  - likes: number
  - verified: number (count of user verifications)
3. Notifications Collection (Sub-collection)
Copyusers/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}
  - type: string
  - content: string
  - relatedPostId: string (optional)
  - location: geopoint (optional)

Implementation Guidelines

Ensure each component follows the SOLID principles you mentioned
Create reusable components for common UI elements
Implement proper error handling and loading states
Document your code thoroughly
Add meaningful commit messages
Test on both iOS and Android

By focusing on these areas, you'll be able to make significant progress on your part of the project without being blocked by your colleague's work. Let me know if you need specific code samples for any of these components!
