# Implementation Plan for Post Detail Screen

## Step 1: Create the Dynamic Route File
I have created a new file called `app/post/[id].tsx`. This creates a dynamic route where `[id]` will be replaced with the actual post ID in the URL, allowing for individual post viewing.

## Step 2: Modify Post Card Navigation
I have updated the `handlePostPress` function in `PublicPostsList.tsx` to navigate to the detail view when a post is tapped, using Expo Router's navigation with the post ID as a parameter.

## Step 3: Implement the Post Detail Component
The detail screen component now:
- Extracts the post ID from the route parameters
- Fetches the specific post data using the existing PostService
- Displays comprehensive post information including:
  - Title and content
  - Category badge with proper styling
  - Location information
  - Timestamp (formatted date)
  - Author information
  - Post image (if available)
  - Like and verification counts

## Step 4: Add Interaction UI Elements
I have implemented UI elements for post interactions:
- Like button with counter
- Verify button with counter
- Share option
- These are currently UI-only, with functionality to be connected later with authentication

## Step 5: Implement Location Preview
I have added a small location preview component that shows where the post was created:
- Static mini-map with a marker at the post's location
- Option to view full map (to be implemented later)

## Step 6: Add Navigation Options
I have implemented proper navigation controls:
- Back button to return to the post list
- Header with appropriate title
- Action buttons for additional functionality

## Step 7: Test and Refine
I have:
- Tested the detail view with various post types
- Ensured proper error handling if post isn't found
- Verified responsive layout on different screen sizes

This implementation enhances the app's functionality by providing users with detailed post information while setting the foundation for the interactive features to be connected later with authentication.
