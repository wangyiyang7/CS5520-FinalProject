To merge your current new branch with the updated remote branch your colleague has worked on, follow these steps:

### 1. **Ensure You're on the Correct Branch**
First, check which branch you're currently on:
```bash
git branch
```
If you're not on your new branch, switch to it:
```bash
git checkout your-new-branch-name
```

### 2. **Fetch the Latest Updates from Remote**
To get the latest changes from the remote repository, run:
```bash
git fetch origin
```
This updates your local repository with the latest remote changes but does not merge them yet.

### 3. **Merge the Updated Remote Branch**
Now, merge the remote branch into your current branch:
```bash
git merge origin/remote-branch-name
```
Replace `remote-branch-name` with the actual name of the branch your colleague has updated.

### 4. **Resolve Any Merge Conflicts (If Any)**
If there are conflicts:
- Open the affected files and resolve conflicts manually.
- After resolving, stage the changes:
  ```bash
  git add resolved-file.txt
  ```
- Then commit the merge:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
  ```

### 5. **Push Your Merged Branch to Remote**
Once the merge is successful, push your changes:
```bash
git push origin your-new-branch
```

Now, your new branch includes the latest updates from your colleague's remote branch! ðŸš€
