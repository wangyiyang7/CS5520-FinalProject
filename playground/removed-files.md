After reviewing the project files, here are some that appear to be either redundant, unused, or not directly relevant to the core functionality we're developing for the Local Buzz app:

### Files that could be removed:

1. **HelloWave.tsx** - Seems to be a demo animation component not central to the app's functionality.

2. **ParallaxScrollView.tsx** - A specialized scroll view that doesn't appear to be used in the current app architecture.

3. **reset-project.js** - A utility script for resetting the project, not needed for the actual application functionality.

4. **ExternalLink.tsx** - Unless you plan to have external links in your app, this utility component could be unnecessary.

5. **Collapsible.tsx** - Unless you have specific UI elements that need to be collapsible, this might not be needed.

6. **MyWeather.tsx** - Since you already have CompactWeather.tsx which appears to be the preferred weather component for the app.

7. **Alarm.tsx** - Unless you need this specific implementation for notifications (you might want to build a more integrated notification system).

8. **Some test files** - Files like `ThemedText-test.tsx` if you're not currently focusing on testing.

9. **expo-env.d.ts** - As the comment in the file says, it should not be edited and should be in your gitignore. It's automatically managed by Expo.

Keep in mind that you should only remove these files if you're certain they're not being referenced elsewhere in the project. Before deleting, you may want to search for imports of these components throughout the codebase.

Now, let's proceed with implementing the post creation form. Would you like me to start drafting the code for that?
